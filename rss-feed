&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were the requirements elicitation activities performed by an experienced analyst?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Was a shared vision, reflecting the organization's senior stakeholders perspective of the purpose and scope of the product/application/system, developed and documented?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were the principal groups of users of the product/application/system identified?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were the principal groups of users' characteristics documented?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were representatives of these user groups identified?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were representatives of these user groups available for consultation?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were these representatives empowered to make decisions on behalf of the users they represented?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were appropriate resources allocated to requirements gathering and documentation?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the organization has an approved process for requirements elicitation, was it followed?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were the risks of poor requirements gathering identified and documented?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are the techniques used to elicit the requirements appropriate for the users?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were the reasonings behind requirements clarified by asking 'why'?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were the lessons learned from previous project post-mortems/retrospectives taken into consideration when planning requirements gathering activities?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were there opportunities to go back to users for more information?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have solution descriptions presented by users been exposed, and the underlying specific need uncovered?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were the documented requirements analyzed to ensure thorough understanding?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are users' needs clearly understood as separated from the implementation?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were all feailure modes to be handled by the system identified?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is the user who originated the requirement recorded?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are industry/business-specific terms defined in a glossary?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any headline which ends in a question mark can be answered by the word &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, instead of simply dismissing the question, I decided to think it through a little more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Good&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only benefit I can think of for offshore outsourcing is how much cheaper it is than paying the salaries of software developers, or even the price of an onshore solution. However, I would always look into both of those alternatives first before thinking about looking into offshore outsourcing, and only if it were my last resort would I choose it. It just strikes me as &quot;wrong&quot;, which is completely and totally subjective, but is due to my bias as a software developer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only use case I can think of would be if I were a brand new startup with limited capital and I needed to get some &lt;a href=&quot;http://projects.csail.mit.edu/gsb/old-archive/gsb-archive/gsb2000-02-11.html&quot;&gt;yak shaving&lt;/a&gt; done to help me reach a target date. Even then, I would be hesitant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Bad&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the many reasons against offshore outsourcing is that since it is offshore (I mean, it's in the name), and since you're outsourcing (and thus, are exporting your work to a country with cheaper labor) there is a very high likelyhood that the native language of the chosen country is not English.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the degree to which this is detrimental can vary a bit. For example, if you were to say, outsource to an Eastern European country, their native language may not be English, but it is more likely that they will have a professional working proficiency of the language. This is not necessarily the case if you were to outsource to a place such as India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another thing to take into consideration is that you will eventually have to maintain the code you're outsourcing, unless you're simply outsourcing your entire product. At that point, is it even your product anymore? Ideas are are a dime a dozen, it's the implementation that's difficult and reaps the most rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are going to maintain the code later on, you'll be paying some developer to go through and clean up the code and add features. This could take considerably more time and effort depending on the quality of the code base that the developer has to work with, and you'll have to cross your fingers that things such as variables, functions, classes, etcetera are named in English and not in the native tongue of the outsourced developer that originally wrote it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Ugly&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have the &quot;ugly&quot; reasons against offshore outsourcing. For one, there's always the question of the time difference. Like was stated before when discussing language barriers, it all depends on which country you end up using. For example, if you're located in San Francisco (UTC -5:00) and you choose to use a company located in Mumbai, India (UTC +5:30), the time difference will be 10.5 hours. This means that you'll have to have any real-time discussions, via telephone, Skype, etc, either very early in the morning or very late in the evening. If you choose a company located in Bucharest, Romania (UTC +2:00), the time difference will be &quot;just&quot; 8 hours, which is better, but still not anywhere close to being ideal for real-time communication. Which leads me to my point, any sort of non-trivial time difference will significantly slow development when any sort of clarification of requirements (or clarification of anything really) is required as you will either need to communicate via a slower method such as email, or you will need to wake up very early or stay very late to communicate in real-time. Both of these add significant delays to your project which add up over time to non-trivial costs of time, resources, and money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One last &quot;ugly&quot; concern of offshore outsourcing is that you really need to be certain to pay careful attention to the company's reputation when selecting one for outsourcing and you should be certain that the code you receive is free of vulnerabilities and back-doors. If your company does not have the domain knowledge necessary to do so, you will need to hire yet &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; company to audit the code for you. Now you could simply choose to not care about your users' security, but does that really sound like a way to win and keep customers? I for one would be very hesitant about supporting such a company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, I believe that the potential savings posed by offshore outsourcing are not truly savings, but are simply deferring the cost of development to a later point in time. Now, depending on the resources of a company, this could be an advantageous move, say if you were a startup with limited resources that just needs a little push to get going. However, if you have the resources to outsource the project onshore or even to hire developers, I believe there are few good reasons to choose offshore outsourcing over the other alternatives which have been presented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Betteridge's law was right once again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any headline which ends in a question mark can be answered by the word &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A conversation with several managers in the order processing department has revealed that about 1 out of every 30 orders for conference phone setups is unusual. How many previous orders should you inspect if you want to have a 95% level of certainty that you covered all variations? What criteria would you use to select these orders? Be sure to show your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Probability of unusual order (p) = 1/30&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Acceptable level of error (a) = 1-.95 &amp;lt;==&amp;gt; .05&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Certaintiy level (z-score, z) = 1.96&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sample Size Formula: p(1-p)((z/a)^2)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Substituting above values: (1/30)(29/30)((1.96/.05)^2) = 49.513955556&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the above calculation, you should inspect 50 orders, ensuring that they were randomly selected for inspection.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Assignment 2 Question 2 and 3</title><link>http://yacn.me/2014/01/28/assignment2-question2-and-3/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><description>&lt;h1&gt;Assignment 2 Question 2&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identify at least 10 functional and 5 non-functional solution requirements for the interactive shopping assistant. Are your requirements effective? Write your requirements as narrative statements that are SMART: specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and testable. Number each requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Functional Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As a Willard's customer, I want to scan an article of clothing and see recommendations/information generated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As a Willard's customer, I want to know whether an item of clothing is available in a given size.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As the VP of Sales and Marketing, I want to collect information about customer choice in order to make better decisions about inventory and merchandising.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As the VP of Sales and Marketing, I want to be able to send messages to customers about ongoing promotions and sales.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As a Willard's customer, I want to know about any sales that are applicable to my current digital shopping cart.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As a Willard's merchandising manager, I want to easily update the system with new lines of clothing when they become available.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As a Willard's customer, I want a login system to provide a more personalized user experience.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As a Willard's customer, I want the ability to bookmark items of clothing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As a Willard's customer, I want to know when and if the prices of my bookmarked items go down.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As a Willard's sales associate, I want to be able to see a customer's recommendations during checkout to provide opportunities to up-sell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Non-functional Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The system may not initially cost more than $75,000 to build&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Licensing costs of software may not exceed $500/year&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The system must allow multi-user access with at least 20 concurrent users&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It should run on iOS with a target platform of iPad.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It must be easily deployable and should require minimal operational maintenance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Assignment 2 Question 3&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What strategy would you use in this project to prioritize the requirements? Prioritize the requirements found previously according to your strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prioritization strategy we have chosen is Subjective Ranking from a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being the lowest priority and 10 being the highest. The following are the above requirements ordered from highest to owest priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;10: As a Willard's customer, I want to scan an article of clothing and see recommendations/information generated. 10: As a Willard's merchandising manager, I want to easily update the system with new lines of clothing when they become available. 8: As the VP of Sales and Marketing, I want to collect information about customer choice in order to make better decisions about inventory and merchandising. 7: As a Willard's customer, I want to know whether an item of clothing is available in a given size. 6: As a Willard's customer, I want a login system to provide a more personalized user experience. 5: As a Willard's customer, I want the ability to bookmark items of clothing. 5: As the VP of Sales and Marketing, I want to be able to send messages to customers about ongoing promotions and sales. 3: As a Willard's sales associate, I want to be able to see a customer's recommendations during checkout to provide opportunities to up-sell. 2: As a Willard's customer, I want to know about any sales that are applicable to my current digital shopping cart. 1: As a Willard's customer, I want to know when and if the prices of my bookmarked items go down.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Assignment 2 Question 1</title><link>http://yacn.me/2014/01/28/assignment2-question1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><description>&lt;h1&gt;Assignment 2 Question 1&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identify the stakeholders for the interactive shopping assistant. For each stakeholder list their name, title, role on the project (provider, reviewer, approver of requirements), influence on the project, and how they might be affected by the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Charles Samir&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Senior Sales Associate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Role: Provider of requirements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Influence: Mr. Samir is acting as a Subject Matter Expert for the project and will provide the viewpoint of a sales associate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Affected: Empowered by using the app, customers will be more likely to approach Mr. Samir and other sales associates for advice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Janice Gengras&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;VP of Technology&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Role: Reviewer of requirements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Influence: Ms Gengras is in charge of managing the overall project and its implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Affected: Since Ms Gengras is in charge of technology, she will need to support this project once it has been completed and is in use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tom Higgins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;VP of Sales and Marketing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Role: Provider and reviewer of requirements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Influence: As the VP of Sales and Marketing, Mr. Higgins will influence what metrics will be collected about consumers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Affected: Mr. Higgins will have more customer metrics than had this project not existed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dave Hester&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;CTO&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Role: Reviewer and approved of requirements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Influence: Approved the project and provided funding.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Affected: It will look bad for him if this project fails or flounders.&lt;/li&gt;

The benefit of cloud-based is the cost of porting to other platforms, or rather, that there is no cost. Since HTML5 and JavaScript support are standard on mobile devices now, it means theres only one codebase to maintain for the app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefit of client/server based is that the app would be a native app on the target platform, which can lead to a much more cohesive user experience. The downside is that if you want to support more than one platform, you must maintain separate codebases for each.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Assignment 1 Question 5</title><link>http://yacn.me/2014/01/16/assignment1-question5/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><description>&lt;h1&gt;Assignment 1 Question 5&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Requirements Elicitation Strategies for &quot;Looking Sharp&quot;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The four requirements elicitation strategies I believe would be best suited to obtain the requirements for the &quot;Looking Sharp&quot; case study are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brainstorming&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interviewing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Observation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Discovery Prototyping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Brainstorming&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one would work well to help flesh out the initial idea with more information and thought, it's easy to accomplish, and can be followed up with one of the other methods mentioned below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Interviewing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As noted in the text, brainstorming is almost always followed up with interviewing (or observation). Interviewing would be easy enough to accomplish as &quot;Chuck&quot; works in the department store and could ask customers if they'd be willing to be interviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Observation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to the point above, since Chuck works in the department store, he's in the prime position to observe and take notes on customer behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Discovery Prototyping&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one would come in at later stages and would help discover requirements that people may not have thought of when imagining the app in their heads.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Assignment 1 Question 4</title><link>http://yacn.me/2014/01/16/assignment1-question4/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><description>&lt;h1&gt;Assignment 1 Question 4&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Scrum Alliance Certifications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today we will discuss two certifications provided by the Scrum Alliance, Certified Scrum Master (CSM) and Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO). But first, who is the Scrum Alliance? The Scrum Alliance is a membership organization that evangelizes the adoption of the Scrum methodology, a type of Agile project management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Certified Scrum Master&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What is it?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Certified Scrum Master (CSM) certification shows that the person fully understands the Scrum methodology and its goals, enabling them to help the rest of their team to work together and learn more about Scrum. Additionally, they help to protect the team from internal and external distractions. In essenence, it is a certification you can receive for the position of ScrumMaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Requirements&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The requirements to become a CSM are straightforward. You must take a CSM course from a Certified Scrum Trainer. Afterwards, you must take the certification test and receive a passing score. Finally, you must accept the License Agreement and complete your Scrum Alliance membership profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Certified Scrum Product Owner&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What is it?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO) certification shows that you have a solid understanding of the Scrum framework, including the terminology, practices, and principles. This enables them to fullfill the role of Product Owner on a Scrum team. Generally, they are closest to the &quot;business side&quot; of a project, being charged by the organization to &quot;get the product out&quot; while doing their best to satisfy all the stakeholders. They maintain the product's backlog and ensure everyone knows the priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Requirements&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the Certified Scrum Master certification, the first step to obtaining the status of Certified Scrum Product Owner is to attend a CSPO course taught by a Certified Scrum Trainer. However, unlike the CSM certification, there is no test required to become a CSPO, attending the course is enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Attainable by Graduation?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe that both of these certifications are absolutely obtainable before I graduate in 2016. However, will I seek them? Probably not. For one, they cost &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of money. Looking at the CSM course being taught in Boston from January 20th to the 2st, it costs $1275! The CSPO course being taught February 6th to the 7th costs $2000! That's a lot of cash I would rather spend on other things. For the cost of both of those certifications, I could take my girfriend and I on a vacation to Turks and Caicos, I could pay off a chunk of my student loans, there are a lot of better uses for the money for me at this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, neither of the certifications seem all that useful to me. Perhaps if I were interested in becoming a consultant or business analyst, this post would be ending differently, but since I desire neither of those careers, I am going to save my money and do something else.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Assignment 1 Question 3</title><link>http://yacn.me/2014/01/16/assignment1-question3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><description>&lt;h1&gt;Assignment 1 Question 3&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Four Years and $13 Million Later&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2008, Overstock.com executives restated their earnings for the previous five-and-a-half years. This led to a $12.9 million decrease in revenue and $10.3 million increase to cumulative net loss. What caused this mess? A rushed Oracle Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) rollout that started in 2005. Leading up to the rushed rollout was a separate $14.2 million loss as well as a customer service meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the next few years, CEO Patrick Byrne wrote letter after letter to the shareholders, detailing why things were going the way they were, all leading back to the rushed ERP rollout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why did it fail?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poor planning, not enough resources, and a rushed sense of urgency. When Overstock was upgrading their system, they did not hook up some &quot;accounting wiring&quot; because there were supposed to be manual fixes in place to take care of it. However, those same manual fixes missed some &quot;wires&quot;, causing the wildly inconsistent performance in the ERP system, meaning issues like some customers would not receive a shipping confirmation, somtimes orders would become stuck in the system, and sometimes the order would become misrouted and go off to the wrong place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid such a mess, careful planning and care must be taken when dealing with such mission-critical systems as ERPs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Where are they now?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overstock seems to be doing well and Patrick Byrne is still CEO. In fact, Overstock just recently partnered with Coinbase to begin accepting Bitcoins as a form of payment. &lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
