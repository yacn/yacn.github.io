The benefit of cloud-based is the cost of porting to other platforms, or rather, that there is no cost. Since HTML5 and JavaScript support are standard on mobile devices now, it means theres only one codebase to maintain for the app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefit of client/server based is that the app would be a native app on the target platform, which can lead to a much more cohesive user experience. The downside is that if you want to support more than one platform, you must maintain separate codebases for each.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Assignment 1 Question 4</title><link>http://yacn.me/2014/01/16/assignment1-question5/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><description>&lt;h1&gt;Requirements Elicitation Strategies for &quot;Looking Sharp&quot;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The four requirements elicitation strategies I believe would be best suited to obtain the requirements for the &quot;Looking Sharp&quot; case study are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brainstorming&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interviewing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Observation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Discovery Prototyping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brainstorming&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one would work well to help flesh out the initial idea with more information and thought, it's easy to accomplish, and can be followed up with one of the other methods mentioned below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Interviewing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As noted in the text, brainstorming is almost always followed up with interviewing (or observation). Interviewing would be easy enough to accomplish as &quot;Chuck&quot; works in the department store and could ask customers if they'd be willing to be interviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Observation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to the point above, since Chuck works in the department store, he's in the prime position to observe and take notes on customer behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Discovery Prototyping&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one would come in at later stages and would help discover requirements that people may not have thought of when imagining the app in their heads.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Assignment 1 Question 4</title><link>http://yacn.me/2014/01/16/assignment1-question4/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><description>&lt;h1&gt;Scrum Alliance Certifications&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today we will discuss two certifications provided by the Scrum Alliance, Certified Scrum Master (CSM) and Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO). But first, who is the Scrum Alliance? The Scrum Alliance is a membership organization that evangelizes the adoption of the Scrum methodology, a type of Agile project management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Certified Scrum Master&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is it?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Certified Scrum Master (CSM) certification shows that the person fully understands the Scrum methodology and its goals, enabling them to help the rest of their team to work together and learn more about Scrum. Additionally, they help to protect the team from internal and external distractions. In essenence, it is a certification you can receive for the position of ScrumMaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The requirements to become a CSM are straightforward. You must take a CSM course from a Certified Scrum Trainer. Afterwards, you must take the certification test and receive a passing score. Finally, you must accept the License Agreement and complete your Scrum Alliance membership profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Certified Scrum Product Owner&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is it?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO) certification shows that you have a solid understanding of the Scrum framework, including the terminology, practices, and principles. This enables them to fullfill the role of Product Owner on a Scrum team. Generally, they are closest to the &quot;business side&quot; of a project, being charged by the organization to &quot;get the product out&quot; while doing their best to satisfy all the stakeholders. They maintain the product's backlog and ensure everyone knows the priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the Certified Scrum Master certification, the first step to obtaining the status of Certified Scrum Product Owner is to attend a CSPO course taught by a Certified Scrum Trainer. However, unlike the CSM certification, there is no test required to become a CSPO, attending the course is enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Attainable by Graduation?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe that both of these certifications are absolutely obtainable before I graduate in 2016. However, will I seek them? Probably not. For one, they cost &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of money. Looking at the CSM course being taught in Boston from January 20th to the 2st, it costs $1275! The CSPO course being taught February 6th to the 7th costs $2000! That's a lot of cash I would rather spend on other things. For the cost of both of those certifications, I could take my girfriend and I on a vacation to Turks and Caicos, I could pay off a chunk of my student loans, there are a lot of better uses for the money for me at this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, neither of the certifications seem all that useful to me. Perhaps if I were interested in becoming a consultant or business analyst, this post would be ending differently, but since I desire neither of those careers, I am going to save my money and do something else.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Assignment 1 Question 3</title><link>http://yacn.me/2014/01/16/assignment1-question3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><description>&lt;h1&gt;Four Years and $13 Million Later&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2008, Overstock.com executives restated their earnings for the previous five-and-a-half years. This led to a $12.9 million decrease in revenue and $10.3 million increase to cumulative net loss. What caused this mess? A rushed Oracle Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) rollout that started in 2005. Leading up to the rushed rollout was a separate $14.2 million loss as well as a customer service meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the next few years, CEO Patrick Byrne wrote letter after letter to the shareholders, detailing why things were going the way they were, all leading back to the rushed ERP rollout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why did it fail?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poor planning, not enough resources, and a rushed sense of urgency. When Overstock was upgrading their system, they did not hook up some &quot;accounting wiring&quot; because there were supposed to be manual fixes in place to take care of it. However, those same manual fixes missed some &quot;wires&quot;, causing the wildly inconsistent performance in the ERP system, meaning issues like some customers would not receive a shipping confirmation, somtimes orders would become stuck in the system, and sometimes the order would become misrouted and go off to the wrong place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid such a mess, careful planning and care must be taken when dealing with such mission-critical systems as ERPs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Where are they now?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overstock seems to be doing well and Patrick Byrne is still CEO. In fact, Overstock just recently partnered with Coinbase to begin accepting Bitcoins as a form of payment. &lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Assignment 1 Question 2</title><link>http://yacn.me/2014/01/16/assignment1-question2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><description>&lt;h1&gt;Information System Tools Matrix&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive img-thumbnail blog-image&quot; src=&quot;/images/is3500-a1q2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Assignment 1 Question 1</title><link>http://yacn.me/2014/01/16/assignment1-question1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><description>&lt;h1&gt;Google Drive Terms of Service Liability&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the hardst post to write, as the information is scattered over so many places. However, this is what I've gathered from research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Uptime&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google guarantees 99.9% uptime, which is 8.76 hours of downtime per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Terms of Service&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/&quot;&gt;end-user terms&lt;/a&gt; of service state that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. In short, what belongs to stays yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;https://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/terms/user_terms.html Additionally, section 7 of the user terms of service state:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You agree that Google has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store any Content and other communications maintained or tranmitted by Google services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above seems to imply that if something were to happen to your data, the liability is on you to have a backup, not Google. I believe that this is fair enough, as Google Drive is not billed as a data backup solution. For something like that, you may want to consider Amazon S3 or Glacier, depending on how often you'll access the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthur down in section 7, Google states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You acknowledge that Google may have set no fixed upper limit on the number of transmissions you may send or receive through Google services or the amount of storage space used; however, we retain the right, at our sole discretion, to create limits at any time with or without notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically, if you become a heavy power user of Google's services, you should probably contact them to ensure that they don't disrupt your operations.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>&quot;The Phoenix Project&quot; Review</title><link>http://yacn.me/2014/01/13/phoenix-project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><description>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Phoenix Project&lt;/em&gt; Review&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Points to hit&lt;/h2&gt;

First, a brief overview of my infrastructure. The systems below marked with &lt;code&gt;VM&lt;/code&gt; are virtual machines hosted on an ESXi box:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Windows Server 2012 &lt;code&gt;VM&lt;/code&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Runs Plex Media Server and serves DNS requests for the network&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ubuntu 12.04 &lt;code&gt;VM&lt;/code&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Runs Sick Beard, CouchPotato, and r(u)torrent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Synology DS413j
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;This is my NAS, holding 4x 3TB drives formatted with Synology Hybrid Raid  for 1 drive redundancy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;System Overviews&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Windows Server 2012 &lt;code&gt;VM&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This box runs Plex Media Server (PMS), which organizes and fetches metadata for all of my media automatically. I chose Windows Server to host this service since at the time, PMS for Linux was beta software and there was no Silverlight support for Linux, meaning I would not be able to run the Netflix channel. This may have changed since then, but I have not looked into it recently. Now, PMS for Linux is out of beta and the Netflix channel has been broken for ages, which I never used anyways because my Roku has a native channel for Netflix. Because of these developments, I am looking into switching back to an all Ubuntu setup as I am a Linux guy at heart, and it will make my future plans easier to implement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, this VM is running the Windows DNS server. I decied to use this over a traditional solution like BIND or dnsmasq mainly due to ease of use. Once I migrate PMS to Ubuntu, I will setup BIND or something similar as there would be no point in running an entire Windows VM just for DNS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Ubuntu 12.04 &lt;code&gt;VM&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This box takes care of the grunt work of the operation. It runs rtorrent, rutorrent, Sick Beard, CouchPotato, and Subsonic. This medly of software takes care of downloading (r(u)torrent), renaming and moving (Sick Beard and CouchPotato), and serving music (Subsonic).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sickbeard.com&quot;&gt;Sick Beard&lt;/a&gt; is a Python webapp built on CherryPy which searches for and manages all of the TV shows I watch. &lt;a href=&quot;https://couchpota.to&quot;&gt;CouchPotato&lt;/a&gt; is a similar webapp also written in Python and based on Tornado, but for movies instead of TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no&quot;&gt;rTorrent&lt;/a&gt; is an ncurses based torrent client I run as a daemon in the background using GNU screen. &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/rutorrent/&quot;&gt;ruTorrent&lt;/a&gt; is a web-frontend to rTorrent built in PHP that can be extended via plugins. I use several, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/rutorrent/wiki/PluginRatio&quot;&gt;Ratio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/rutorrent/wiki/PluginAutotools&quot;&gt;AutoTools&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/rutorrent/wiki/PluginScheduler&quot;&gt;Scheduler&lt;/a&gt; to enhance and improve my workflow. The workflow itself is a tad complex, so it will be discussed in a later post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://subsonic.org&quot;&gt;Subsonic&lt;/a&gt; is a free web-based media streamer which allows me to stream my music collection from anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Synology DS413j&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the systems listed above are accessing, using, and manipulating a lot of data, but none of it, except for software-related files (such as the SQLite dbs used by Plex, Sick Beard, and CouchPotato), is actually stored on those systems. Each of them are mounting shared folders which are located on this NAS. I have Synology Hybrid Raid setup to allow me to add bigger drives incrementally in the as well as giving myself a 1-drive redundancy safety net. Using the software on the Synology itself, I am able to share these folders over my network via NFS, CIFS, and AFP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Plans for the Future&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Migrate to PMS on Ubuntu&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Migrate DNS server to BIND or something similar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implement Chef to automate provisioning of these systems&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Move from ESXi to OpenStack&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implement Sensu or Riemann to monitor the above servers and apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
