&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sales and marketing team at Willard's has started to implement a VIP program in which different levels of status can be achieved depending on annual spending amounts. Depending on the level different discount vouchers are issued monthly. Specifically, they would like to have two levels of VIP status: Silver and Gold. Gold members receive a $100 voucher once they spend a over $2,000, while Silver members get a $50 voucher. If they spend less than $2,000 they get a voucher for half the amount. However, they must spend at least $500. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could model the above as a decision table like so:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ccs.neu.edu/home/iboehman/dt.png&quot;  alt=&quot;Decision Table&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Assignment 2 Question 7</title><link>http://yacn.me/2014/01/28/assignment2-question7/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><description>&lt;h1&gt;Assignment 2 Question 7&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ecee.colorado.edu/~swengctf/standalone/handouts/RequirementsElicitationChecklist.pdf&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were the requirements elicitation activities performed by an experienced analyst?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Was a shared vision, reflecting the organization's senior stakeholders perspective of the purpose and scope of the product/application/system, developed and documented?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were the principal groups of users of the product/application/system identified?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were the principal groups of users' characteristics documented?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were representatives of these user groups identified?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were representatives of these user groups available for consultation?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were these representatives empowered to make decisions on behalf of the users they represented?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were appropriate resources allocated to requirements gathering and documentation?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the organization has an approved process for requirements elicitation, was it followed?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were the risks of poor requirements gathering identified and documented?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are the techniques used to elicit the requirements appropriate for the users?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were the reasonings behind requirements clarified by asking 'why'?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were the lessons learned from previous project post-mortems/retrospectives taken into consideration when planning requirements gathering activities?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were there opportunities to go back to users for more information?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have solution descriptions presented by users been exposed, and the underlying specific need uncovered?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were the documented requirements analyzed to ensure thorough understanding?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are users' needs clearly understood as separated from the implementation?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were all feailure modes to be handled by the system identified?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is the user who originated the requirement recorded?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are industry/business-specific terms defined in a glossary?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any headline which ends in a question mark can be answered by the word &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, instead of simply dismissing the question, I decided to think it through a little more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Good&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only benefit I can think of for offshore outsourcing is how much cheaper it is than paying the salaries of software developers, or even the price of an onshore solution. However, I would always look into both of those alternatives first before thinking about looking into offshore outsourcing, and only if it were my last resort would I choose it. It just strikes me as &quot;wrong&quot;, which is completely and totally subjective, but is due to my bias as a software developer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only use case I can think of would be if I were a brand new startup with limited capital and I needed to get some &lt;a href=&quot;http://projects.csail.mit.edu/gsb/old-archive/gsb-archive/gsb2000-02-11.html&quot;&gt;yak shaving&lt;/a&gt; done to help me reach a target date. Even then, I would be hesitant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Bad&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the many reasons against offshore outsourcing is that since it is offshore (I mean, it's in the name), and since you're outsourcing (and thus, are exporting your work to a country with cheaper labor) there is a very high likelyhood that the native language of the chosen country is not English.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the degree to which this is detrimental can vary a bit. For example, if you were to say, outsource to an Eastern European country, their native language may not be English, but it is more likely that they will have a professional working proficiency of the language. This is not necessarily the case if you were to outsource to a place such as India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another thing to take into consideration is that you will eventually have to maintain the code you're outsourcing, unless you're simply outsourcing your entire product. At that point, is it even your product anymore? Ideas are are a dime a dozen, it's the implementation that's difficult and reaps the most rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are going to maintain the code later on, you'll be paying some developer to go through and clean up the code and add features. This could take considerably more time and effort depending on the quality of the code base that the developer has to work with, and you'll have to cross your fingers that things such as variables, functions, classes, etcetera are named in English and not in the native tongue of the outsourced developer that originally wrote it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Ugly&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have the &quot;ugly&quot; reasons against offshore outsourcing. For one, there's always the question of the time difference. Like was stated before when discussing language barriers, it all depends on which country you end up using. For example, if you're located in San Francisco (UTC -5:00) and you choose to use a company located in Mumbai, India (UTC +5:30), the time difference will be 10.5 hours. This means that you'll have to have any real-time discussions, via telephone, Skype, etc, either very early in the morning or very late in the evening. If you choose a company located in Bucharest, Romania (UTC +2:00), the time difference will be &quot;just&quot; 8 hours, which is better, but still not anywhere close to being ideal for real-time communication. Which leads me to my point, any sort of non-trivial time difference will significantly slow development when any sort of clarification of requirements (or clarification of anything really) is required as you will either need to communicate via a slower method such as email, or you will need to wake up very early or stay very late to communicate in real-time. Both of these add significant delays to your project which add up over time to non-trivial costs of time, resources, and money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One last &quot;ugly&quot; concern of offshore outsourcing is that you really need to be certain to pay careful attention to the company's reputation when selecting one for outsourcing and you should be certain that the code you receive is free of vulnerabilities and back-doors. If your company does not have the domain knowledge necessary to do so, you will need to hire yet &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; company to audit the code for you. Now you could simply choose to not care about your users' security, but does that really sound like a way to win and keep customers? I for one would be very hesitant about supporting such a company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, I believe that the potential savings posed by offshore outsourcing are not truly savings, but are simply deferring the cost of development to a later point in time. Now, depending on the resources of a company, this could be an advantageous move, say if you were a startup with limited resources that just needs a little push to get going. However, if you have the resources to outsource the project onshore or even to hire developers, I believe there are few good reasons to choose offshore outsourcing over the other alternatives which have been presented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Betteridge's law was right once again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any headline which ends in a question mark can be answered by the word &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A conversation with several managers in the order processing department has revealed that about 1 out of every 30 orders for conference phone setups is unusual. How many previous orders should you inspect if you want to have a 95% level of certainty that you covered all variations? What criteria would you use to select these orders? Be sure to show your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Probability of unusual order (p) = 1/30&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Acceptable level of error (a) = 1-.95 &amp;lt;==&amp;gt; .05&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Certaintiy level (z-score, z) = 1.96&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sample Size Formula: p(1-p)((z/a)^2)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Substituting above values: (1/30)(29/30)((1.96/.05)^2) = 49.513955556&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the above calculation, you should inspect 50 orders, ensuring that they were randomly selected for inspection.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Assignment 2 Question 2 and 3</title><link>http://yacn.me/2014/01/28/assignment2-question2-and-3/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><description>&lt;h1&gt;Assignment 2 Question 2&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identify at least 10 functional and 5 non-functional solution requirements for the interactive shopping assistant. Are your requirements effective? Write your requirements as narrative statements that are SMART: specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and testable. Number each requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Functional Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As a Willard's customer, I want to scan an article of clothing and see recommendations/information generated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As a Willard's customer, I want to know whether an item of clothing is available in a given size.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As the VP of Sales and Marketing, I want to collect information about customer choice in order to make better decisions about inventory and merchandising.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As the VP of Sales and Marketing, I want to be able to send messages to customers about ongoing promotions and sales.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As a Willard's customer, I want to know about any sales that are applicable to my current digital shopping cart.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As a Willard's merchandising manager, I want to easily update the system with new lines of clothing when they become available.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As a Willard's customer, I want a login system to provide a more personalized user experience.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As a Willard's customer, I want the ability to bookmark items of clothing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As a Willard's customer, I want to know when and if the prices of my bookmarked items go down.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As a Willard's sales associate, I want to be able to see a customer's recommendations during checkout to provide opportunities to up-sell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Non-functional Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The system may not initially cost more than $75,000 to build&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Licensing costs of software may not exceed $500/year&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The system must allow multi-user access with at least 20 concurrent users&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It should run on iOS with a target platform of iPad.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It must be easily deployable and should require minimal operational maintenance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Assignment 2 Question 3&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What strategy would you use in this project to prioritize the requirements? Prioritize the requirements found previously according to your strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prioritization strategy we have chosen is Subjective Ranking from a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being the lowest priority and 10 being the highest. The following are the above requirements ordered from highest to owest priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;10: As a Willard's customer, I want to scan an article of clothing and see recommendations/information generated. 10: As a Willard's merchandising manager, I want to easily update the system with new lines of clothing when they become available. 8: As the VP of Sales and Marketing, I want to collect information about customer choice in order to make better decisions about inventory and merchandising. 7: As a Willard's customer, I want to know whether an item of clothing is available in a given size. 6: As a Willard's customer, I want a login system to provide a more personalized user experience. 5: As a Willard's customer, I want the ability to bookmark items of clothing. 5: As the VP of Sales and Marketing, I want to be able to send messages to customers about ongoing promotions and sales. 3: As a Willard's sales associate, I want to be able to see a customer's recommendations during checkout to provide opportunities to up-sell. 2: As a Willard's customer, I want to know about any sales that are applicable to my current digital shopping cart. 1: As a Willard's customer, I want to know when and if the prices of my bookmarked items go down.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Assignment 2 Question 1</title><link>http://yacn.me/2014/01/28/assignment2-question1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><description>&lt;h1&gt;Assignment 2 Question 1&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identify the stakeholders for the interactive shopping assistant. For each stakeholder list their name, title, role on the project (provider, reviewer, approver of requirements), influence on the project, and how they might be affected by the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Charles Samir&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Senior Sales Associate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Role: Provider of requirements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Influence: Mr. Samir is acting as a Subject Matter Expert for the project and will provide the viewpoint of a sales associate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Affected: Empowered by using the app, customers will be more likely to approach Mr. Samir and other sales associates for advice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Janice Gengras&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;VP of Technology&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Role: Reviewer of requirements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Influence: Ms Gengras is in charge of managing the overall project and its implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Affected: Since Ms Gengras is in charge of technology, she will need to support this project once it has been completed and is in use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tom Higgins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;VP of Sales and Marketing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Role: Provider and reviewer of requirements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Influence: As the VP of Sales and Marketing, Mr. Higgins will influence what metrics will be collected about consumers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Affected: Mr. Higgins will have more customer metrics than had this project not existed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dave Hester&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;CTO&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Role: Reviewer and approved of requirements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Influence: Approved the project and provided funding.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Affected: It will look bad for him if this project fails or flounders.&lt;/li&gt;

The benefit of cloud-based is the cost of porting to other platforms, or rather, that there is no cost. Since HTML5 and JavaScript support are standard on mobile devices now, it means theres only one codebase to maintain for the app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefit of client/server based is that the app would be a native app on the target platform, which can lead to a much more cohesive user experience. The downside is that if you want to support more than one platform, you must maintain separate codebases for each.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
