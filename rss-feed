A while back, we were running into an issue with phantom keepalive alerts due to how Sensu was determining whether or not a node still existed. The way it was determining this was to query our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.getchef.com&quot;&gt;Chef&lt;/a&gt; server to check whether or not the client and node existed there. However, due to how we provision and terminate nodes (using an internal knife plugin), the clients and nodes on the Chef server are not removed until the next time they are to be created. (Really, we should update the deletion component to remove the clients and nodes, but it is a low priority at this point).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to this workflow, when we would terminate a cluster, we would encounter a &quot;keepalive storm&quot;, where we would be flooded with keepalive alerts for the cluster we just terminated. This would cause our Sensu server to become overloaded with queued up events to handle. When our next Chef run would execute, the Sensu server would be signaled to restart. However, due to the massive event queue that had built up, the time needed to restart the process would exceed the threshold set for the service's script, set in &lt;code&gt;/etc/default/sensu&lt;/code&gt;. I believe the default was 10 seconds, we increased it to 30 while investigating to try and soothe the inevitable Chef runs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the process would nearly always fail to restart, which caused the Chef run to fail and would leave teh Sensu server in an incorrect state. The remedy this state, we owuld need to manually stop and start each of the Sensu components (API, server, client) manually. This was very annoying and inconveniencing, so I set out to find a fix for the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To solve our phantom keepalives and subsequent &quot;keepalive storms&quot;, I created a Sensu handler for the keepalive event. When it handles a keepalive event, instead of checking the Chef server to determine whether the node still exists, it checks EC2. If the node is not found in EC2, it is removed from Sensu as a client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we implemented this handler at work, we were able to eliminate the &quot;keepalive storms&quot; and phantom keepalive alerts, thus increasing the stability of our Sensu server. You can check out the plugin in the official &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sensu/sensu-community-plugins/blob/master/handlers/other/ec2_node.rb&quot;&gt;Sensu Community Plugins&lt;/a&gt; repository on GitHub. Hopefully it will be of some use to others.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Fixing dvm with Test Kitchen</title><link>http://yacn.me/2014/02/24/dvm-test-kitchen-docker/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><description>&lt;h1&gt;Fixing dvm with Test Kitchen&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Finding dvm&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past few weeks at work, I've been conducting research on the side with the goal of setting up a continuous integration environment for our Chef cookbooks. I've decided to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://kitchen.ci&quot;&gt;Test Kitchen&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/portertech/kitchen-docker&quot;&gt;kitchen-docker&lt;/a&gt; driver as the base for our integration testing framework (of which the specifics are out of the scope of this post).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that I'd chosen our stack, it was time to get kitchen-docker, Test Kitchen, and Docker working together. I needed a solution which would allow me to work with Docker locally on OS X. Luckily, there are two related projects allowing me to do just that, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fnichol/dvm&quot;&gt;dvm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker&quot;&gt;boot2docker&lt;/a&gt; (dvm is actually just a wrapper around Vagrant using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mitchellh/boot2docker-vagrant-box&quot;&gt;boot2docker box&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bumpy start&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first issue I ran into was Docker choosing a network range which conflicted with the network range our work runs in. I'd actually run into this issue before, several months ago when I was first testing out Docker. At the time, there was no immediate workaround, so put it in the back of my mind for later. Docker has since been updated to attempt to be smart about choosing the network range by looking for any conflicting networks. However, this issue still affects us because Docker is being run through a VM, meaning it will not detect the conflicting network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A more recent addition to Docker is the &lt;code&gt;--bip=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; option, which you can use to specify a CIDR range for the &lt;code&gt;docker0&lt;/code&gt; bridge that Docker creates. However, to use this new feature with dvm, I was going to need to make some modifications to support it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Modifying dvm&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way dvm works is by allowing you to set configuration options in a file &lt;code&gt;~/.dvm/dvm.conf&lt;/code&gt;. Those settings are environment variables which are exported when creating the boot2docker VM. To add support for &lt;code&gt;--bip&lt;/code&gt;, I added the configuration directive &lt;code&gt;DOCKER0_CIDR&lt;/code&gt; to the config file. I then modified the &lt;code&gt;Vagrantfile&lt;/code&gt; to use the new argument if specified. I saved my changes, crossed my fingers, and typed &lt;code&gt;dvm up&lt;/code&gt;. To my dismay, passing in that option didn't seem to affect anything!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;(Re)building the bridge&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After some more reading, I learned that if the &lt;code&gt;docker0&lt;/code&gt; bridge has already been created, the IP range assigned to it will not be affected by the &lt;code&gt;--bip&lt;/code&gt; option. To use the option, you need to first make sure the &lt;code&gt;docker0&lt;/code&gt; bridge does not exist when starting Docker, meaning that if it does exist, it will need to be deleted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deleting a bridge seems simple enough, you just need to run &lt;code&gt;brctl delbr nameofbridge&lt;/code&gt;. Unfortunately, the &lt;code&gt;brctl&lt;/code&gt; utility is not included in the release of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tinycorelinux.net/&quot;&gt;Tiny Core Linux&lt;/a&gt; used by boot2docker. I now set off to find a bridge-utils package I could install on the distro. Fortunately I didn't need to dig for too long, there was a link to such a package in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/blob/master/doc/FAQ.md&quot;&gt;one of the docs&lt;/a&gt; for boot2docker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now all I needed to do was update the &lt;code&gt;Vagrantfile&lt;/code&gt; to check whether or not the &lt;code&gt;DOCKER0_CIDR&lt;/code&gt; option was set, and if so, setup the arguments, stop the currently running Docker daemon, install the bridge utils, and remove the &lt;code&gt;docker0&lt;/code&gt; bridge. I ran &lt;code&gt;dvm up&lt;/code&gt; and low and behold, it worked!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By this time I'm feeling pretty good, I've gotten much farther than ever before. I run &lt;code&gt;kitchen create&lt;/code&gt; to create a container and, you guessed it, it worked! Running &lt;code&gt;kitchen converge&lt;/code&gt; also worked as expected, which is great as now my container can access hosts within our local network as well as the internet at large! Satisfied with myself, I ran &lt;code&gt;kitchen destroy&lt;/code&gt; to delete the containers. Oh no, it doesn't work!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;One last jam&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I ran into a jam (damn you Chris Christie!), running &lt;code&gt;kitchen destroy&lt;/code&gt; throws an exception! Looking at the message returned, it seems to be an issue related with trying to stop and remove the container, something appears to be holding a lock over it:&lt;/p&gt;

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
docker@boot2docker:~$ exit
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hmm, so it looks like the container was actually stopped. Researching this issue led me to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dotcloud/docker/issues/2714#issuecomment-34408878&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; thread. The issue seems to be related to using a symlink where Docker expects its runtime root to be. By default, this is &lt;code&gt;/var/lib/docker&lt;/code&gt;, but in boot2docker, this has been symlinked to &lt;code&gt;/mnt/sda/var/lib/docker&lt;/code&gt;. This causes Docker to be unable to stop or remove any of the containers it creates, as it doesn't seem to follow the symlink. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The remedy is to use the &lt;code&gt;-g&lt;/code&gt; option to set the path to use as the root of Docker's runtime to the directory the symlink points to. Looking at the file in boot2docker where the Docker daemon is started (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/blob/master/rootfs/rootfs/usr/local/etc/init.d/docker#L18&quot;&gt;/usr/local/etc/init.d/docker&lt;/a&gt;), it seems like the &lt;code&gt;-g&lt;/code&gt; option should already be provided. All the more curious and needs further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A &lt;code&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt; to far&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The culprit, it turns out, is the &lt;code&gt;Vagrantfile&lt;/code&gt; used by dvm! In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fnichol/dvm/blob/master/Vagrantfile#L89&quot;&gt;provisioning script&lt;/a&gt; used to restart the Docker daemon with the args provided in &lt;code&gt;DOCKER_ARGS&lt;/code&gt;, there's a &lt;code&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt; command which looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sed -i -e &amp;#39;s|docker -d .* $EXPOSE_ALL|docker -d #{args}|&amp;#39; $INITD
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;where: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;$INITD&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/etc/init.d/docker&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;$EXPOSE_ALL&lt;/code&gt; is a variable set in that file&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;#{args}&lt;/code&gt; is the string interpolation of the &lt;code&gt;args&lt;/code&gt; defined in &lt;code&gt;DOCKER_ARGS&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This command is only run if you modify either &lt;code&gt;args&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;DOCKER_ARGS&lt;/code&gt;, which is how I believe it slipped through the cracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happens is the part of the line in &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/etc/init.d/docker&lt;/code&gt; that is specifying the &lt;code&gt;-g&lt;/code&gt; option is wiped out when the new &lt;code&gt;args&lt;/code&gt; are added to the command. There were a few options to solving this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Update the README to state that if you modify &lt;code&gt;DOCKER_ARGS&lt;/code&gt;, you must make sure to include the &lt;code&gt;-g&lt;/code&gt; option&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Update the &lt;code&gt;Vagrantfile&lt;/code&gt; to check if &lt;code&gt;DOCKER_ARGS&lt;/code&gt; is modified, and if so, to check that it includes the &lt;code&gt;-g&lt;/code&gt; option, adding it if it does not.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Update the &lt;code&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt; command to save the &lt;code&gt;-g&lt;/code&gt; option and use a backreference to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;I chose to implement option 3 as it seemed the simplest and most transparent way to accomplish the goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;One last run&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the changes in place, it was time to test them out again. I created a new &lt;code&gt;dvm&lt;/code&gt; VM with the updated &lt;code&gt;Vagrantfile&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;dvm.conf&lt;/code&gt; specifying &lt;code&gt;DOCKER0_CIDR&lt;/code&gt;. Once that was created, I checked to make sure the &lt;code&gt;docker0&lt;/code&gt; bridge had the new IP range. So far, so good, so I ran &lt;code&gt;kitchen create&lt;/code&gt; and watched as Test Kitchen pulled in the Ubuntu repo and created a container for me. Still looking good, but all of this did work before. I enter &lt;code&gt;kitchen destroy&lt;/code&gt; for the final test and...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;WooHoo! It works! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To summarize, I needed to update dvm to allow me to set the IP range of the &lt;code&gt;docker0&lt;/code&gt; bridge. This required me to install bridge-utils for &lt;code&gt;brctl&lt;/code&gt; to remove the previously created &lt;code&gt;docker0&lt;/code&gt; bridge before my new IP range could take effect. Once that was implemented, I discovered a bug in the provisioning script for dvm causing which prevented stopping or deleting containers. Both fixes are currently open as pull requests:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sales and marketing team at Willard's has started to implement a VIP program in which different levels of status can be achieved depending on annual spending amounts. Depending on the level different discount vouchers are issued monthly. Specifically, they would like to have two levels of VIP status: Silver and Gold. Gold members receive a $100 voucher once they spend a over $2,000, while Silver members get a $50 voucher. If they spend less than $2,000 they get a voucher for half the amount. However, they must spend at least $500. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could model the above as a decision table like so:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ccs.neu.edu/home/iboehman/dt.png&quot;  alt=&quot;Decision Table&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Assignment 2 Question 7</title><link>http://yacn.me/2014/01/28/assignment2-question7/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><description>&lt;h1&gt;Assignment 2 Question 7&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ecee.colorado.edu/~swengctf/standalone/handouts/RequirementsElicitationChecklist.pdf&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were the requirements elicitation activities performed by an experienced analyst?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Was a shared vision, reflecting the organization's senior stakeholders perspective of the purpose and scope of the product/application/system, developed and documented?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were the principal groups of users of the product/application/system identified?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were the principal groups of users' characteristics documented?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were representatives of these user groups identified?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were representatives of these user groups available for consultation?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were these representatives empowered to make decisions on behalf of the users they represented?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were appropriate resources allocated to requirements gathering and documentation?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the organization has an approved process for requirements elicitation, was it followed?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were the risks of poor requirements gathering identified and documented?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are the techniques used to elicit the requirements appropriate for the users?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were the reasonings behind requirements clarified by asking 'why'?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were the lessons learned from previous project post-mortems/retrospectives taken into consideration when planning requirements gathering activities?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were there opportunities to go back to users for more information?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have solution descriptions presented by users been exposed, and the underlying specific need uncovered?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were the documented requirements analyzed to ensure thorough understanding?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are users' needs clearly understood as separated from the implementation?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were all feailure modes to be handled by the system identified?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is the user who originated the requirement recorded?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are industry/business-specific terms defined in a glossary?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any headline which ends in a question mark can be answered by the word &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, instead of simply dismissing the question, I decided to think it through a little more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Good&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only benefit I can think of for offshore outsourcing is how much cheaper it is than paying the salaries of software developers, or even the price of an onshore solution. However, I would always look into both of those alternatives first before thinking about looking into offshore outsourcing, and only if it were my last resort would I choose it. It just strikes me as &quot;wrong&quot;, which is completely and totally subjective, but is due to my bias as a software developer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only use case I can think of would be if I were a brand new startup with limited capital and I needed to get some &lt;a href=&quot;http://projects.csail.mit.edu/gsb/old-archive/gsb-archive/gsb2000-02-11.html&quot;&gt;yak shaving&lt;/a&gt; done to help me reach a target date. Even then, I would be hesitant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Bad&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the many reasons against offshore outsourcing is that since it is offshore (I mean, it's in the name), and since you're outsourcing (and thus, are exporting your work to a country with cheaper labor) there is a very high likelyhood that the native language of the chosen country is not English.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the degree to which this is detrimental can vary a bit. For example, if you were to say, outsource to an Eastern European country, their native language may not be English, but it is more likely that they will have a professional working proficiency of the language. This is not necessarily the case if you were to outsource to a place such as India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another thing to take into consideration is that you will eventually have to maintain the code you're outsourcing, unless you're simply outsourcing your entire product. At that point, is it even your product anymore? Ideas are are a dime a dozen, it's the implementation that's difficult and reaps the most rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are going to maintain the code later on, you'll be paying some developer to go through and clean up the code and add features. This could take considerably more time and effort depending on the quality of the code base that the developer has to work with, and you'll have to cross your fingers that things such as variables, functions, classes, etcetera are named in English and not in the native tongue of the outsourced developer that originally wrote it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Ugly&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have the &quot;ugly&quot; reasons against offshore outsourcing. For one, there's always the question of the time difference. Like was stated before when discussing language barriers, it all depends on which country you end up using. For example, if you're located in San Francisco (UTC -5:00) and you choose to use a company located in Mumbai, India (UTC +5:30), the time difference will be 10.5 hours. This means that you'll have to have any real-time discussions, via telephone, Skype, etc, either very early in the morning or very late in the evening. If you choose a company located in Bucharest, Romania (UTC +2:00), the time difference will be &quot;just&quot; 8 hours, which is better, but still not anywhere close to being ideal for real-time communication. Which leads me to my point, any sort of non-trivial time difference will significantly slow development when any sort of clarification of requirements (or clarification of anything really) is required as you will either need to communicate via a slower method such as email, or you will need to wake up very early or stay very late to communicate in real-time. Both of these add significant delays to your project which add up over time to non-trivial costs of time, resources, and money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One last &quot;ugly&quot; concern of offshore outsourcing is that you really need to be certain to pay careful attention to the company's reputation when selecting one for outsourcing and you should be certain that the code you receive is free of vulnerabilities and back-doors. If your company does not have the domain knowledge necessary to do so, you will need to hire yet &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; company to audit the code for you. Now you could simply choose to not care about your users' security, but does that really sound like a way to win and keep customers? I for one would be very hesitant about supporting such a company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, I believe that the potential savings posed by offshore outsourcing are not truly savings, but are simply deferring the cost of development to a later point in time. Now, depending on the resources of a company, this could be an advantageous move, say if you were a startup with limited resources that just needs a little push to get going. However, if you have the resources to outsource the project onshore or even to hire developers, I believe there are few good reasons to choose offshore outsourcing over the other alternatives which have been presented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Betteridge's law was right once again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any headline which ends in a question mark can be answered by the word &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A conversation with several managers in the order processing department has revealed that about 1 out of every 30 orders for conference phone setups is unusual. How many previous orders should you inspect if you want to have a 95% level of certainty that you covered all variations? What criteria would you use to select these orders? Be sure to show your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Probability of unusual order (p) = 1/30&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Acceptable level of error (a) = 1-.95 &amp;lt;==&amp;gt; .05&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Certaintiy level (z-score, z) = 1.96&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sample Size Formula: p(1-p)((z/a)^2)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Substituting above values: (1/30)(29/30)((1.96/.05)^2) = 49.513955556&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the above calculation, you should inspect 50 orders, ensuring that they were randomly selected for inspection.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Assignment 2 Question 2 and 3</title><link>http://yacn.me/2014/01/28/assignment2-question2-and-3/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><description>&lt;h1&gt;Assignment 2 Question 2&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identify at least 10 functional and 5 non-functional solution requirements for the interactive shopping assistant. Are your requirements effective? Write your requirements as narrative statements that are SMART: specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and testable. Number each requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Functional Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As a Willard's customer, I want to scan an article of clothing and see recommendations/information generated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As a Willard's customer, I want to know whether an item of clothing is available in a given size.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As the VP of Sales and Marketing, I want to collect information about customer choice in order to make better decisions about inventory and merchandising.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As the VP of Sales and Marketing, I want to be able to send messages to customers about ongoing promotions and sales.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As a Willard's customer, I want to know about any sales that are applicable to my current digital shopping cart.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As a Willard's merchandising manager, I want to easily update the system with new lines of clothing when they become available.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As a Willard's customer, I want a login system to provide a more personalized user experience.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As a Willard's customer, I want the ability to bookmark items of clothing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As a Willard's customer, I want to know when and if the prices of my bookmarked items go down.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As a Willard's sales associate, I want to be able to see a customer's recommendations during checkout to provide opportunities to up-sell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Non-functional Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The system may not initially cost more than $75,000 to build&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Licensing costs of software may not exceed $500/year&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The system must allow multi-user access with at least 20 concurrent users&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It should run on iOS with a target platform of iPad.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It must be easily deployable and should require minimal operational maintenance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Assignment 2 Question 3&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What strategy would you use in this project to prioritize the requirements? Prioritize the requirements found previously according to your strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prioritization strategy we have chosen is Subjective Ranking from a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being the lowest priority and 10 being the highest. The following are the above requirements ordered from highest to owest priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;10: As a Willard's customer, I want to scan an article of clothing and see recommendations/information generated. 10: As a Willard's merchandising manager, I want to easily update the system with new lines of clothing when they become available. 8: As the VP of Sales and Marketing, I want to collect information about customer choice in order to make better decisions about inventory and merchandising. 7: As a Willard's customer, I want to know whether an item of clothing is available in a given size. 6: As a Willard's customer, I want a login system to provide a more personalized user experience. 5: As a Willard's customer, I want the ability to bookmark items of clothing. 5: As the VP of Sales and Marketing, I want to be able to send messages to customers about ongoing promotions and sales. 3: As a Willard's sales associate, I want to be able to see a customer's recommendations during checkout to provide opportunities to up-sell. 2: As a Willard's customer, I want to know about any sales that are applicable to my current digital shopping cart. 1: As a Willard's customer, I want to know when and if the prices of my bookmarked items go down.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
