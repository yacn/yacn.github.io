There's been the occasional glitch, e.g the Plex Media Scanner stops running (meaning no new shows are detected) necessitating a restart of the Plex service or the Plex service itself stops working and needs a restart. These issues are minor and take minimal effort to fix as I simply need to RDP in and restart the service. However, there's the occasional issue which requires a bit more manual intervention, such as shows having improper metadata. Since I'm not the only user of the server, there's actually a number of shows present that I do not keep up with at all. What ends up happening is I'll be hanging out with one of my friends and they'll mention some issue they're having with Plex. I then make a mental note to remember to fix it when I return home. Being the human I am, I don't have perfect memory, which means things sometimes slip through the cracks.</p><p>With that in mind, I decided to create a place to file support requests for GUNTER, my Plex server. I created a GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/yacn/gunter-issues">gunter-issues</a> to hold any support requests / issues related to Plex or GUNTER. Using the free service <a href="https://waffle.io">waffle.io</a>, I was able to turn that repo into an <a href="https://waffle.io/yacn/gunter-issues">open and online agile/kanban board</a>. Now, people can file issues with the knowledge that if I forget about it, it's right there on the board. It is my hope that by introducing this, GUNTER/Plex can only improve.</p><h3>Plex Info Page and Icon Fonts</h3><p>While integrating the issue tracker into this site, I wanted to add a link to the a page containing information and resources about Plex. Since it was going to be in the upper-right corner, I wanted it to fit in with the <a href="fontawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a> icons I was already using. I came up with the idea of putting together a version of the Plex Media Center logo in the style of the Font Awesome icons.</p><p>I started by finding the PMS logo and then modified its coloring to fit in with the Font Awesome icons. I ended up with a PNG with transparency, but then realized that this wouldn't scale well if I wanted to use it at a bigger size. I decided at that point to convert it to an SVG. Unfortunately while the software I used to modify the image (<a href="http://www.pixelmator.com/">Pixelmator</a>) supports creating vector-like graphics, it does not support exporting to SVGs. However, I was able to use a piece of software called <a href="http://vectormagic.com/desktop">Vector Magic</a> to take the PSD exported by Pixelmator and feed it in and with about 5 clicks, I had an SVG!</p><p>I then spent quite a bit of time futzing around with the CSS sizing and positioning, trying to get the SVG to appear, but nothing seemed to work. Frustrated and out of ideas, I googled "create own font awesome icons svg" and stumbled upon this awesome RubyGem called <a href="http://fontcustom.com">Font Custom</a>, which takes a directory of SVG files and converts them to a CSS file that you can include on your sites. With this in hand, I was able to convert my SVG into a font and then it was a simple matter of adding an item to the navigation list like all the other links! In the end, I think it looks and feels like a native Font Awesome icon and was well worth the effort to get it going.</p><div id="post-tags">Tags: <a href="/tags/#plex">plex </a><a href="/tags/#media.server">media.server </a><a href="/tags/#personal">personal </a><a href="/tags/#font.awesome">font.awesome </a><a href="/tags/#vector.graphics">vector.graphics </a></div><div class="shares"><a class="twitter-share-button" data-via="yaclevername" href="https://twitter.com/share">Tweet</a></div><br /><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'yacn';var disqus_identifier = 'http://yacn.me' + window.location.pathname;var disqus_url = disqus_identifier;(function() {var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript'; dsq.async = true;dsq.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js';(document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq);})();</script><script type="text/javascript">!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');</script></div></div><script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.0.3/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prettify/r298/prettify.js"></script><script src="/js/yacn.js"></script><div class="footer"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12"><p>Built with <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nakkaya/static">Static</a>.
