# Yet Another Intro Post 

First off, let me thank [Chris Smith](http://crsmithdev.com) for his
[great blog post](http://crsmithdev.com/2013/09/02/a-blog-refresh-with-bootstrap-and-static/)
introducing [Static](http://nakkaya.com/static.html), a Clojure static-site
generator. Without it, I would still be messing around with
[Misaki](https://liquidz.github.io/misaki/), which is a tad more complex than I
wanted at the time.

Also, thanks to [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com) for their collection of
free Bootstrap themes, particularly [Yeti](http://bootswatch.com/yeti), the one
being used on this site.

Look forward to various posts about programming, infrastruture, Plex, life, the
universe, and everything else.
