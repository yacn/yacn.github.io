# Scrum Alliance Certifications

Today we will discuss two certifications provided by the Scrum Alliance,
Certified Scrum Master (CSM) and Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO).
But first, who is the Scrum Alliance? The Scrum Alliance is a membership
organization that evangelizes the adoption of the Scrum methodology,
a type of Agile project management.

## Certified Scrum Master

### What is it?

The Certified Scrum Master (CSM) certification shows that the person
fully understands the Scrum methodology and its goals, enabling them
to help the rest of their team to work together and learn more about
Scrum. Additionally, they help to protect the team from internal and
external distractions. In essenence, it is a certification you can
receive for the position of ScrumMaster.

### Requirements

The requirements to become a CSM are straightforward. You must take a
CSM course from a Certified Scrum Trainer. Afterwards, you must take the
certification test and receive a passing score. Finally, you must accept
the License Agreement and complete your Scrum Alliance membership profile.

## Certified Scrum Product Owner

### What is it?

A Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO) certification shows that you have a
solid understanding of the Scrum framework, including the terminology,
practices, and principles. This enables them to fullfill the role of Product
Owner on a Scrum team. Generally, they are closest to the "business side" of
a project, being charged by the organization to "get the product out" while
doing their best to satisfy all the stakeholders. They maintain the product's
backlog and ensure everyone knows the priorities.

### Requirements

Like the Certified Scrum Master certification, the first step to obtaining the
status of Certified Scrum Product Owner is to attend a CSPO course taught by a
Certified Scrum Trainer. However, unlike the CSM certification, there is no
test required to become a CSPO, attending the course is enough.

## Attainable by Graduation?

I believe that both of these certifications are absolutely obtainable before
I graduate in 2016. However, will I seek them? Probably not. For one, they cost
*a lot* of money. Looking at the CSM course being taught in Boston from January
20th to the 2st, it costs $1275! The CSPO course being taught February 6th to
the 7th costs $2000! That's a lot of cash I would rather spend on other things.
For the cost of both of those certifications, I could take my girfriend and I
on a vacation to Turks and Caicos, I could pay off a chunk of my student loans,
there are a lot of better uses for the money for me at this time.

Additionally, neither of the certifications seem all that useful to me. Perhaps
if I were interested in becoming a consultant or business analyst, this post
would be ending differently, but since I desire neither of those careers, I am
going to save my money and do something else.
