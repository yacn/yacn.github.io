# Assignment 1 Question 5

## Requirements Elicitation Strategies for "Looking Sharp"

The four requirements elicitation strategies I believe would be best
suited to obtain the requirements for the "Looking Sharp" case study
are:

* Brainstorming
* Interviewing
* Observation
* Discovery Prototyping

### Brainstorming

This one would work well to help flesh out the initial idea with more
information and thought, it's easy to accomplish, and can be followed
up with one of the other methods mentioned below.

### Interviewing

As noted in the text, brainstorming is almost always followed up with
interviewing (or observation). Interviewing would be easy enough to
accomplish as "Chuck" works in the department store and could ask
customers if they'd be willing to be interviewed.

### Observation

Similar to the point above, since Chuck works in the department store,
he's in the prime position to observe and take notes on customer
behavior.

### Discovery Prototyping

This one would come in at later stages and would help discover requirements
that people may not have thought of when imagining the app in their
heads.
