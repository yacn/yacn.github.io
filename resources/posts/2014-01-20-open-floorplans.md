# Open Floorplans: The Good, The Bad, The Ugly

BitSight was my first experience in an open floorplan. When I joined
the team for my first co-op, they were a small company consisting of
maybe 25 people total in an office park. There were lots of desks,
all arranged in rows of 2x3 where each employee was given one desk.
Some employees even had drawers. As the company grew, the office space
began to get cramped, so they moved to the next floor up into a much
bigger space. The desks are still clustered into groups of at least 2x2
however. Initially I loved this layout, but now the honeymoon is over
and I have some reservations.

## The Good

As I said before, initially I loved the layout. I'm a shy person, it can be
incredibly difficult to force myself to talk to someone I'm unfamiliar with,
even more so if I've never met them before. With the open floorplan, it was much
easier for me to learn who everybody was and become much more comfortable around
them, especially since I was able to grok what may be going on because I'm able to
hear discussions about it. Additionally, while the company was still small, they would
eat lunch together, which also helped to make me familiar and comfortable with everyone.
However, once comfortable, the cracks began to show.

## The Bad

Simply put, an open floorplan makes it incredibly easy to become distracted which makes it
incredibly difficult to concentrate for an extended period of time. Unless you have headphones
in, you can hear everybody's conversations and if you're unlucky enough to have a desk facing
the door, you see all of the foot traffice outside which can be incredibly visually distracting
as you'll always be looking up due to something in the corner of your eye moving. Additionally,
it's incredibly easy for someone to interrupt you by just walking up to you since the floorplan
is open. This is both a blessing and a curse, as it makes people really easy to find when you need
them, but it also makes yourself incredibly susceptible to interruptions.

## The Ugly

Okay, so all of that's bad enough, what could be worse? A company which does nothing about it!
Thankfully, this does not apply to BitSight. Back in September of 2013, they implemented a policy
of "Quiet Hours" between 2PM and 4PM, meaning nobody is allowed to speak, all communication must
be done via [HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com/) or email. If you need to collaborate with someone,
you must do so in an empty room as to not disturb others. The only exceptions to these rules are
Ops and QA and only if they're being blocked on something (i.e. cannot make any progress). This
policy has helped out tremendously, as there's always a guarantee that you'll have at least two
hours of quiet to focus.

Now that BitSight has more space, they've been actively building more and more office spaces throughout.
While some of these are being transformed into hotel spaces, it seems that most will become more
office spaces. This can only be a good thing, in my mind. Currently it doesn't look like they will
be assigned to people, rather they will be available to be booked as needed, but it is a good first
step in my opinion. While of course it would be ideal for each employee to have their own office, it
simply is not economically feasible to do so.

In conclusion, I've come to a much better understanding of why people dislike open floorplans so much.
While BitSight will continue with their open floorplan for the time being, they're doing all they can
to ensure everybody can have a peaceful, productive working environment, which is really the most I can
ask for.
