# The Evolution of Scrum at BitSight

At Northeastern University, I am in a 5-year program which allows
for me to take 4 years of classes while also obtaining 18 months
of work experience. I completed my first co-op at [BitSight Technologies](https://www.bitsighttech.com/)
(and am currently still working there part-time and will be returning
for my second), which practices agile project management using
[Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28software_development%29).
Working at BitSight was my first experience with Scrum and it has been
interesting to watch how its user has evolved over the last 11 months.
When I started in May of 2013, BitSight was much smaller. The Engineering
team consisted of about 10 full-time staff with about 5 graduate-student
co-ops. At this point, standups still consisted of everybody meeting
together around the kanban board. Eventually, as more full time staff
and co-ops were hired, this became very unsustainable as standups were
taking ~30 minutes to complete as 20 people is far too many (5 - 7 being
the ideal amount). This was noticed fairly quickly and standups now
consist only the necessary representatives from each team / project.
The standups are still slightly larger than ideal, but I predict that
as BitSight continues to grow, the standups will eventually branch off
into smaller, more-focused groups.

Additionally, the Scrum Master initially was an employee who had been,
for lack of a better phrase, stuck with it. They knew the basics, but
not enough to efficiently lead the meetings and optimize team velocity.
When a new engineer with Scrum experience was hired, they eventually took
the reigns as Scrum Master and turned it around. This passing of the torch
has lead to a rotating Scrum Master. That is, every so often, a new employee
is trained how to be Scrum Master and then proceeds to lead the standups
until eventually the next employee is selected and the cycle repeats. I think
this is a brilliant plan, as it gets everyone more involved in the Scrum
process which means that everyone will have a more detailed understanding of
how it works (and why), leading to increased focus and increased agility.
It will definitely be interesting to see how BitSight continues to change
as it grows bigger and bigger.
